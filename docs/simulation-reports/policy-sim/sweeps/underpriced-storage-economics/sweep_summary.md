## High-Risk Runs

| Run | Scenario | Risk | Reasons |
|---|---|---|---|
| `reward-buffer-alone-insufficient` | `underpriced-storage` | `medium` | some providers ended with negative modeled P&L |
| `retrieval-fee-buffer-alone-insufficient` | `underpriced-storage` | `medium` | some providers ended with negative modeled P&L |
| `low-storage-fee-still-negative` | `underpriced-storage` | `medium` | some providers ended with negative modeled P&L |
| `baseline-no-storage-fee` | `underpriced-storage` | `medium` | some providers ended with negative modeled P&L |

## Best Observed Run

`higher-storage-fee-positive-pnl` is the best observed run under the current ordering: zero data loss first, then highest retrieval success, then fewer unavailable reads, capacity violations, negative-P&L providers, and repair backoffs.

This is not an automatic policy choice. It is the run humans should inspect first when deciding which parameter set deserves keeper or e2e implementation work.

## Review Questions

- Which changed parameter plausibly caused the largest movement in availability, repair pressure, and provider economics?
- Did any run improve availability by hiding economic distress, capacity over-assignment, or repair backlog?
- Are unavailable reads explicitly allowed by the scenario contract, and did modeled data loss remain zero?
- Which parameter set should become the baseline for the next keeper/e2e planning slice?
