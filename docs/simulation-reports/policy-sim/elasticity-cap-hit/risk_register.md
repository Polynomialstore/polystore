# Risk Register: Elasticity Cap Hit

Model demand above the user-funded elasticity budget. The desired behavior is fail-closed spending: the simulator should record rejections instead of silently exceeding the configured cap.

## Material Risks

| Risk | Severity | Evidence | Impact | Recommended Follow-Up |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Elasticity demand rejected by spend cap | `medium` | 5 elasticity attempts were rejected. | The system correctly fails closed, but users may experience capacity limits during demand spikes. | Decide whether this is acceptable UX or whether user-funded burst budgets need product controls. |

## Review Questions

- Are the modeled thresholds strict enough to catch griefing without punishing honest jitter?
- Does the risk severity match how we would respond in a real devnet incident?
- Should any risk item become a keeper test, gateway e2e test, or explicit governance parameter decision?
