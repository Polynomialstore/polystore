# Mainnet Parity + Devnet/Testnet Launch Checklist

Companion docs:
- `notes/mainnet_policy_resolution_jan2026.md` (concrete proposal for “B” + staged plan)
- `MAINNET_GAP_TRACKER.md` (canonical gap tracking + DoDs + test gates)

## Stage 0 — Policy freeze → params + interfaces (unblocks engineering)
- [ ] Extend `nilchain/proto/nilchain/nilchain/v1/params.proto` to encode B1/B2/B4/B5/B6 (with validation + genesis defaults).
- [ ] Encode audit budget sizing/caps (Option A): `audit_budget_bps`, `audit_budget_cap_bps`, and bounded carryover (≤2 epochs) for unused budget.
- [ ] Document chosen defaults + rationale in `notes/mainnet_policy_resolution_jan2026.md` and reference from `MAINNET_GAP_TRACKER.md`.

## Stage 1 — Storage lock-in pricing + escrow accounting (A1)
- [ ] Implement pay-at-ingest lock-in pricing on `UpdateDealContent*` per `rfcs/rfc-pricing-and-escrow-accounting.md` (`nilchain/`).
- [ ] Implement deterministic spend window reset + deterministic elasticity debits (`nilchain/`).
- [ ] Add econ e2e: create deal → upload/commit → verify escrow and module account flows (`scripts/`, `tests/`).

## Stage 2 — Retrieval session economics (A2)
- [ ] Enforce session open burns base fee + locks variable fee; rejects insufficient escrow (`nilchain/`).
- [ ] Enforce completion settlement: burn cut + provider payout; cancel/expiry refunds locked fee only (`nilchain/`).
- [ ] Extend econ e2e: open → complete; open → cancel/expire; verify burns/payouts/refunds (`scripts/`, `tests/`).

## Stage 3 — Deterministic challenge derivation + quotas + synthetic fill (A3)
- [ ] Implement deterministic challenge derivation + quota accounting (SPECIFIED in `rfcs/rfc-challenge-derivation-and-quotas.md`) (`nilchain/`).
- [ ] Implement enforcement outcomes: invalid proof → hard fault; quota shortfall → HealthState decay (no slash by default) (`nilchain/`).
- [ ] Add keeper unit tests for determinism + exclusions (REPAIRING slots excluded).
- [ ] Add adversarial sim test gate for anti-grind properties (`scripts/`, `performance/`).

## Stage 4 — HealthState + eviction curve (A6)
- [ ] Implement per-(deal, provider/slot) HealthState updates from hard/soft failures (`nilchain/`).
- [ ] Implement eviction triggers (`evict_after_missed_epochs_hot/cold`) and hook into Mode 2 repair start (`nilchain/`).
- [ ] Add queries/events for observability; add unit tests.

## Stage 5 — Mode 2 repair + make-before-break replacement (A5)
- [ ] Implement make-before-break replacement per `rfcs/rfc-mode2-onchain-state.md` (`nilchain/`).
- [ ] Implement deterministic candidate selection + churn controls (B4) (`nilchain/`).
- [ ] Ensure reads avoid `REPAIRING` slots; synthetic challenges ignore `REPAIRING`; repairing slots do not earn rewards (`nilchain/`, `nil_gateway/`).
- [ ] Add multi-SP repair e2e: slot failure → candidate catch-up → promotion; reads succeed throughout (`scripts/`, `tests/`).

## Stage 6 — Evidence / fraud proofs pipeline (A4)
- [ ] Implement evidence taxonomy + verification + replay protection (`nilchain/`).
- [ ] Wire penalties (slash/jail/evict) to B1 params; integrate with repair start (`nilchain/`).
- [ ] Add unit tests per evidence type + e2e demonstrating slash on proven bad data (`scripts/`, `tests/`).

## Stage 7 — Deputy market + proxy retrieval + audit debt (P0-P2P-001)
- [ ] Implement deputy/proxy retrieval end-to-end: selection, routing, and settlement (B5) (`polystore_p2p/`, `nilchain/`, `nil_gateway/`).
- [ ] Implement proof-of-failure aggregation with threshold/window (B1) and anti-griefing (B5) (`nilchain/`).
- [ ] Add ghosting-provider e2e: still retrieve via deputy and record evidence (`scripts/`).

## B) Policy decisions to encode (proposal summary)

See `notes/mainnet_policy_resolution_jan2026.md` for full details.

- [ ] **B1 Slashing/jailing ladder:** hard faults slash immediately; non-response uses threshold/window; quota shortfall decays HealthState.
- [ ] **B2 Bonding:** base provider bond + assignment collateral scaled by slot bytes and `storage_price`.
- [ ] **B3 Pricing defaults:** derive `storage_price` from GiB-month target; define retrieval base + per-blob + burn bps; define halving interval policy.
- [ ] **B4 Replacement selection:** deterministic candidate ranking seeded by epoch randomness; cooldown + attempt caps.
- [ ] **B5 Deputy incentives:** proxy premium payout + evidence bond/bounty + audit debt funding choice (Option A vs B).
- [ ] **B6 Credits phase-in:** implement accounting first; enable quota reduction caps later (devnet→testnet→mainnet).

## Test gates (launch blockers)
- [ ] Chain econ e2e with multiple parameter sets (`scripts/`, `tests/`).
- [ ] Challenge determinism + anti-grind sim (`scripts/`, `performance/`).
- [ ] Ghosting-provider deputy e2e (`scripts/`).
- [ ] Health/repair e2e (replacement without read outage) (`scripts/`).
